# Software Development & Delivery

## Build

**Choose Your Methodology:** Decide on a consistent approach for how you build software (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Kanban).

**Standardize Your Tools:** Establish a common set of tools for coding, version control (like Git), and project tracking.

**Define a 'Definition of Done':** Create a clear checklist that every new feature or piece of code must meet before it's considered complete.

**Automate Your Pipeline:** Set up automated processes for building, testing, and deploying your code to ensure speed and consistency.

## Manage

**Hold Regular Stand-ups:** Have brief, daily meetings to keep the team aligned and identify any roadblocks.

**Track Your Progress:** Use a project management tool to keep track of tasks, bugs, and feature requests.

**Prioritize Security:** Make security a part of the development process from the beginning, not an afterthought (DevSecOps).

**Review and Refactor:** Regularly look back at your code and processes to find opportunities for improvement and clean-up.

## Maturity

- [ ] Does your team follow a consistent development process?
- [ ] Is all your code stored in a central version control system?
- [ ] Do you have an automated process for testing your code?
- [ ] Is security considered at the beginning of every project?

## Achievements

- [ ] NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
