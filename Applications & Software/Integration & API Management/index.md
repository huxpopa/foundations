# Integration & API Management

## Build

**Map Your Connections:** Identify and document all the ways your different applications talk to each other.

**Choose Your Tools:** Select and establish a primary platform or set of tools for building and managing integrations and APIs.

**Set the Rules:** Create clear standards for how new integrations should be built, secured, and documented.

**Develop a Central Catalog:** Create a searchable catalog of all available integrations and APIs so developers know what they can use.

## Manage

**Monitor Everything:** Keep a close watch on the health and performance of all your integrations and APIs to catch problems early.

**Control Access:** Implement a strict process for granting and reviewing access to your APIs and data connections.

**Review and Improve:** Regularly meet with development teams to discuss the integration process and find ways to make it better.

**Communicate Changes:** When an API or integration is updated, make sure all the teams who use it are fully aware of the changes.

## Maturity

- [ ] Do you have a list of all your key integrations and APIs?
- [ ] Is there a standard process for requesting a new integration?
- [ ] Do you monitor your APIs for errors and performance issues?
- [ ] Do you have a central place for developers to find available APIs?

## Achievements

- [ ] NIST SP 800-204
