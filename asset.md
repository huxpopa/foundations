# Asset
Asset management is critical to every organization.  What assets are important to your organization?  

## Keys to Asset Management
- Your goal is to track every asset.  You will not succeed, but never quit trying.
- Identify someone as accountable for the Asset Management program as a whole.
- Identity someone as accountable for each class of asset.
- Define every class of asset and each important attribute.
- Document 4 processes for each asset class:
    - Enrollment
    - Changes
    - Lost or Stolen
    - Retirement
- Centralize a real time view of all assets by type
- Build report(s) to identify rogue and missing assets

## Manage
- Hold a regular program meeting with asset type owners
- Frequency of meetings is determined by organization size
- Key metrics are reported by asset type owners
- Opportunities for improvement are discussed and tracked
- Changes to processes are communicated
