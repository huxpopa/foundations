# Asset Management

## Keys to Asset Management

*   **Define every type of asset:** Clearly categorize and define each type of asset within the organization.
*   **Designate someone accountable for each asset type:** Assign clear ownership for the lifecycle management of each asset type.
*   **Have clear definitions for important asset attributes:** Establish standardized definitions for critical asset data points (e.g., serial number, location, owner, status).
*   **Document 4 processes for each asset type:**
    *   **Enrollment:** How assets are acquired, recorded, and brought into service.
    *   **Changes:** Procedures for updating asset information, transfers, or modifications.
    *   **Lost or Stolen:** Protocols for reporting, investigating, and responding to missing assets.
    *   **Retirement:** Steps for decommissioning, disposal, and removal of assets from inventory.
*   **Centralize a real-time view of all assets by type:** Implement a system or process to maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive inventory of all assets.
*   **Build report(s) to identify rogue and missing assets:** Develop mechanisms to detect and report assets that are not properly accounted for or are outside defined policies.

## Manage

*   **Hold a regular program meeting with asset type owners:** Facilitate recurring meetings to discuss asset management status and issues.
*   **Frequency of meetings is determined by organization size:** Adjust meeting cadences based on the scale and complexity of the organization's asset base.
*   **Key metrics are reported by asset type owners:** Track and review performance indicators related to asset lifecycle management.
*   **Opportunities for improvement are discussed and tracked:** Continuously identify and implement enhancements to asset management processes.
*   **Changes to processes are communicated:** Ensure all stakeholders are informed of updates and modifications to asset management procedures.
