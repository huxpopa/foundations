# Service Catalog Management

## Build

**List Your Services:** Identify every IT service you provide to the business (e.g., "New Laptop Request," "Password Reset").

**Define Each Service:** For each service, write a simple, plain-language description of what it is, who it's for, and any costs.

**Design the User View:** Create a simple, easy-to-use portal or site where users can browse and request services.

**Establish a Fulfillment Process:** For each service, document the step-by-step process that happens behind the scenes after a user clicks "request."

## Manage

**Keep It Accurate:** Regularly review every service in the catalog to make sure its description and details are still correct.

**Get Feedback:** Ask users for feedback on the catalog to find out if it's easy to use and how it can be improved.

**Report on Service Usage:** Track which services are being requested most often to understand business demand.

**Manage the Lifecycle:** Have a process for adding new services to the catalog and retiring old ones.
