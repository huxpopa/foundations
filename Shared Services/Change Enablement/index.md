# Change Enablement

## Build

**Define What a 'Change' Is:** Create a clear definition of what kind of IT changes need to be formally managed (e.g., a server update, a new firewall rule).

**Create a Change Process:** Design a simple, straightforward process for how changes are requested, approved, and implemented.

**Form a Change Advisory Board (CAB):** Establish a group of people who will review and approve high-risk changes.

**Set Up a Change Calendar:** Create a shared calendar that shows when all planned IT changes are scheduled to happen.

## Manage

**Review All Changes:** Hold regular CAB meetings to discuss upcoming changes and assess their potential risks.

**Communicate Effectively:** Make sure everyone who might be affected by a change knows about it ahead of time.

**Handle Emergency Changes:** Have a separate, faster process for dealing with urgent changes that need to happen immediately.

**Review Past Changes:** Look back at recently implemented changes to see if they were successful and if anything could have been done better.
