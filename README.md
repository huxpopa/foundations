# Welcome

This is the Foundations collection. A crowdsourced, community driven blueprint for building a strong foundation for your service oriented organization.  Focusing on the fundamentals over the complex.

## Rules
- Stay constructive and acknowledge we are not all perfect
- Keep it short and to the point
- Limit jargon or complex words
- Hyperlinks can be used inline, but should not disrupt the content, include references at the bottom where possible
- Focus on content that is applicable to all types and sizes or organizations

## Structure
Foundations is organized into 3 levels:

```
Service Category
|---Business Service
    |---Service Offering
```

Since all organizations are different, it is impossible to build a common framework that applies to all organizations perfectly.  However, it is possible for all organizations to pull value from this structure by mapping the content that makes the most sense to what you are working on.
