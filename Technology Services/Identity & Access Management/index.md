# Identity & Access Management (IAM)

## Build

**Create a Central Identity Store:** Establish a single source of truth (like Active Directory or an Okta Universal Directory) for all user identities.

**Define Access Roles:** Create roles based on job functions (e.g., "Accountant," "Sales Rep") that have pre-defined access to specific applications.

**Automate Onboarding and Offboarding:** Create a process to automatically grant access when a new employee joins and, more importantly, revoke all access when they leave.

**Enable Single Sign-On (SSO):** Connect as many applications as possible to an SSO solution so users only have to log in once.

## Manage

**Regularly Review Access:** Have managers or application owners periodically review who has access to their systems and data.

**Enforce Strong Authentication:** Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical applications and remote access.

**Monitor for Suspicious Logins:** Actively look for unusual login activity, such as logins from strange locations or at odd hours.

**Provide a Great User Experience:** Make it easy for users to request access and manage their own passwords without creating security risks.

## Maturity

- [ ] Do you have one central system where all user accounts are managed?
- [ ] Is the process for removing a departing employee's access automated?
- [ ] Do you require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your most critical systems?
- [ ] Do managers have to periodically review their team's access rights?

## Achievements

- [ ] NIST SP 800-63
