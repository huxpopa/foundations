# Hosting

## Build

**Know Your Environments:** Make a list of all your hosting environments, whether they are on-premises data centers, in the cloud, or both.

**Create Standard Builds:** Develop a set of standard, pre-configured server "images" or templates for different workloads (e.g., web server, database server).

**Define Your Hosting Options:** Create a simple menu of hosting options that application owners can choose from.

**Automate Provisioning:** Build automated scripts and processes to quickly deploy new servers and environments.

## Manage

**Monitor Everything:** Keep a close watch on the health, performance, and capacity of all your hosted systems.

**Manage Costs:** If using the cloud, regularly review your spending and look for ways to optimize costs.

**Keep Systems Patched:** Have a consistent process for applying security patches and updates to all your servers.

**Plan for Capacity:** Forecast future needs and make sure you have a plan to add more capacity before you run out.
