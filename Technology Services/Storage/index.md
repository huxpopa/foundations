# Storage

## Build

**Know Your Data:** Understand the different types of data you have and their different storage requirements (e.g., high-performance for databases, cheap and deep for archives).

**Define Your Storage Tiers:** Create a menu of standard storage options with different performance and cost characteristics.

**Establish a Backup Policy:** Define how often data is backed up, how many copies are kept, and how long they are stored for.

**Automate Provisioning:** Create scripts and templates to make it fast and easy to provide new storage to application owners.

## Manage

**Monitor Capacity:** Keep a very close eye on how much storage is being used and forecast when you will need to add more.

**Track Performance:** Monitor the performance of your storage systems to ensure they are meeting the needs of the applications that rely on them.

**Test Your Backups:** Regularly perform test restores to make sure your backups are working correctly and that you can actually recover data from them.

**Manage Costs:** Understand the cost of each of your storage tiers and help application owners choose the most cost-effective option for their needs.
