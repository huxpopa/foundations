# Collaboration

## Build

**Choose Your Tools:** Select a standard set of tools for company-wide collaboration, such as for email, chat, video conferencing, and file sharing.

**Set Clear Guidelines:** Create simple rules for how each tool should be used (e.g., "Use chat for quick questions, email for formal requests").

**Provide Training:** Offer basic training to all employees to make sure everyone knows how to use the standard collaboration tools effectively.

**Integrate Your Tools:** Where possible, make sure your collaboration tools work together smoothly (e.g., a video meeting can be scheduled from a chat).

## Manage

**Get Feedback from Users:** Regularly ask employees what's working and what's not with the current set of tools.

**Monitor Usage:** Keep an eye on which tools are being used and which are not, to understand what people find most helpful.

**Stay Up-to-Date:** Keep your tools updated and periodically evaluate new ones to see if they could improve how the company works together.

**Promote Best Practices:** Share tips and success stories to help everyone get the most out of the collaboration tools.
