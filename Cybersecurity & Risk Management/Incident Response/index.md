# Incident Response

## Build

**Define What an 'Incident' Is:** Create clear definitions for what counts as a security incident (e.g., a virus outbreak, a data leak).

**Create a Response Plan:** Write a step-by-step plan that says exactly what to do when a security incident happens.

**Form a Response Team:** Designate a specific group of people who are on call to handle security incidents.

**Prepare Your Tools:** Get the tools and access you need in place *before* an incident happens.

## Manage

**Practice, Practice, Practice:** Run regular drills and tabletop exercises to test your response plan.

**Keep the Plan Current:** Review and update your incident response plan at least annually, or after any major incident.

**Learn from Every Incident:** After an incident is resolved, conduct a "lessons learned" meeting to find out what could be done better next time.

**Communicate Clearly:** Have a communication plan ready for how you will inform employees, customers, and leadership during an incident.
