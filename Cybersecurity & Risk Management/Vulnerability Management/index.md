# Vulnerability Management

## Build

**Scan Your Systems:** Implement a tool to regularly scan all your computers, servers, and applications for known vulnerabilities.

**Create a Patching Policy:** Define how quickly different types of vulnerabilities must be fixed, based on their severity.

**Assign Ownership:** Make it clear which teams are responsible for fixing vulnerabilities on which systems.

**Establish a Process:** Document the end-to-end process: from when a vulnerability is found to when it is fixed and verified.

## Manage

**Prioritize Your Findings:** Focus on fixing the most critical vulnerabilities on your most important systems first.

**Track Everything:** Maintain a central list of all open vulnerabilities, who is assigned to fix them, and when they are due.

**Report Your Progress:** Create regular reports for leadership and system owners showing the current state of vulnerabilities and progress on fixing them.

**Handle Exceptions:** Have a formal process for situations where a vulnerability cannot be fixed immediately.

## Maturity

- [ ] Do you regularly scan your systems for vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Do you have a written policy for how quickly vulnerabilities must be fixed?
