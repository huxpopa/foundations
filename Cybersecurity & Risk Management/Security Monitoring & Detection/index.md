# Security Monitoring & Detection

## Build

**Identify What to Monitor:** Determine the most important systems and data, and what kinds of activities you need to watch.

**Collect the Logs:** Set up a centralized system to gather security logs from all your critical systems (like a SIEM).

**Create Basic Alerts:** Write rules to automatically alert your team about common, high-priority security events (e.g., too many failed logins).

**Define a Monitoring Process:** Document who is responsible for watching the alerts and what they should do when one fires.

## Manage

**Tune Your Alerts:** Regularly review your alerts to reduce "false positives" and make sure you're only being notified about real issues.

**Actively Hunt for Threats:** Don't just wait for alerts. Proactively search through your logs for signs of unusual or suspicious activity.

**Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date on the latest attacker techniques and tactics so you know what to look for.

**Report on Your Findings:** Create regular reports for leadership on what you're seeing and any significant threats you've detected.
