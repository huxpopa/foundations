# Security Architecture & Engineering

## Build

**Define Security Principles:** Establish a short list of core principles that guide all security design decisions (e.g., "least privilege," "defense in depth").

**Create Standard Blueprints:** Develop secure, pre-approved designs for common systems and applications (e.g., a secure web server, a standard employee laptop build).

**Select Security Tools:** Choose the standard security technologies the organization will use for things like firewalls, antivirus, and encryption.

**Integrate Security into Design:** Create a process to ensure security is a required part of the discussion for every new IT project.

## Manage

**Review New Designs:** Hold formal reviews to make sure that new projects and systems are being built according to your security blueprints.

**Evaluate New Technologies:** When a new technology is considered, have a process to evaluate its security features and risks.

**Update Your Standards:** Regularly review and update your security principles and blueprints to keep up with new threats and technologies.

**Collaborate and Advise:** Act as internal consultants, helping other IT teams build, buy, and deploy technology securely.

## Maturity

- [ ] Do you have a set of guiding security design principles?
- [ ] Do you have standard, secure "templates" for deploying new systems?
- [ ] Is security architecture reviewed as part of every new major project?
- [ ] Do you have a standard set of approved security tools?
