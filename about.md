> Foundations provides the shortest path to building simple, effective and service oriented capabilities within their organizations

As organizations grow, managing and governing becomes complicated. Orgs turn to frameworks and consultants to help with basic functions  that should be obvious and simple. These are fundamental things that most organizations deal with and have very little to do with the uniqueness of the individual organization. 

There are numerous frameworks that have sprung from business functions. Meant to help reign in chaos and provide standardization, these frameworks are valuable and sometimes necessary if not mandated. However, the sad reality is that sometimes these frameworks require years of study, certifications and a PhD to understand them. They come with new terms, diagrams and what becomes an entirely new complicated thing to untangle.  

Oftentimes these frameworks are generic and adaptable, but all you want is to skip the complication and go right to value.

Foundations aims to be all value and as little complexity as possible.  Detailed, focused and straight to the point. 

Tackling each fundamental business function of the modern organization one at a time.  Foundations will remain agnostic to departments and unique organization needs and focus on things that should be standardized across most organizations.

Foundations will deliver multiple blocks of value to organizations over time. Each block will be increasingly more detailed and valuable.  Larger organizations will benefit more from the additional blocks, while smaller organizations may be satisfied with only the initial block. The first block is in development and would help to prove the viability of this project.  

Initially, Foundations will be developed directly on GitHub and open for collaboration until a longer term direction is established.  [Get involved](./get-involved/) if you are interseted in helping shape the future of Foundations.
